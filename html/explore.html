              During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you
              can join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery.
              Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more
              about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.

              As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to
              create places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to
              give your students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our
              learning laboratory, and provide great video presentations that
              will excite and inspire them.

              Please get in touch with us here to find out more about our
              facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students through
              for a visit.

            <h3>For Parents</h3>
            <p>
              Parents can support their children's interest in science by
              creating an environment that encourages curiosity and critical
              thinking. Engaging in conversations, providing access to science
              materials, conducting hands-on experiments, and visiting
              science-related events or museums all contribute to fostering a
              lifelong love for science.
